## GPX schema version 1.1 - For more information on GPX and this schema, visit http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp
##
## GPX uses the following conventions: all coordinates are relative to the WGS84 datum.  All measurements are in metric units.
start |= gpx
gpx =

  ## GPX is the root element in the XML file.
  element gpx { gpxType }

## GPX documents contain a metadata header, followed by waypoints, routes, and tracks.  You can add your own elements
## to the extensions section of the GPX document.
gpxType =

  ## Metadata about the file.
  element metadata { metadataType }?,

  ## A list of waypoints.
  element wpt { wptType }*,

  ## A list of routes.

## Information about the GPX file, author, and copyright restrictions goes in the metadata section.  Providing rich,
## meaningful information about your GPX files allows others to search for and use your GPS data.
